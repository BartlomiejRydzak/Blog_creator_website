# Blog Creator Website

Welcome to the Blog Creator Website! This is a simple web application built using Node.js with the Express framework. It allows you to simulate creating, editing, and deleting blog posts. However, please note that the website currently lacks a database implementation, so all posts will be reset after refreshing the page.

## Installation

To run the website locally on your computer, follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js**: If you haven't already, you'll need to install Node.js on your machine. You can download it from [the official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/BartlomiejRydzak/Blog_creator_website.git
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies using npm:

    ```
    cd blog-creator-website
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the website locally:

1. **Run the Server**: Start the Node.js server by running the following command:

    ```
    node index.js
    ```

2. **Access the Website**: Open your web browser and navigate to `localhost:3000`. You should see the Blog Creator Website interface.

3. **Create, Edit, and Delete Posts**: You can now simulate creating, editing, and deleting blog posts using the website interface. However, remember that the data is not persisted, so all posts will be lost after refreshing the page or restarting the server.
